 ![`Metal`](metal.png "Metal")
 
 
 `Metal` is an Application Programming Interface (API) made by Apple that runs on all `macOS`, `iOS`, and `tvOS`. It provides a way for us to 'talk' to our GPU, since we all want beautiful and fast graphics right?
 
 ## Why do we have to talk to the GPU?
 
 GPU stands for Graphical Processing Unit. It's a computer component that's very efficient in handling graphics operation. Why? Unlike CPU, GPU has a big number of cores. Typically thousands of it, to process millions of lightweight graphics operation.
 
 ## What makes Metal different?
 
 `Metal` was designed by Apple and it is **not** cross platform (unlike `OpenGL`), but it is very optimized to run efficiently and gave the best performance on all Apple devices yet.
 
 ## How does `Metal` work?
 
 Excited to know how it works?
